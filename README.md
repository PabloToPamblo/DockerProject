# Project: Real Environment Simulation with Django, Docker, and Kubernetes

This project aims to simulate a production environment using Django within a Docker container and managing the containers through Kubernetes.

The main idea is to replicate a realistic environment for the development and deployment of web applications while efficiently maintaining the containers.

## Technologies Used

- **Django**: Web development framework in Python.
- **Docker**: For containerizing the project, facilitating a replicable and consistent environment.
- **Kubernetes**: For orchestrating and maintaining the containers, allowing for scalability and application management.

## Objective

This project is designed to learn and apply the use of Docker and Kubernetes in a real development environment with Django. Docker ensures the creation of controlled and replicable environments, while Kubernetes implements automation for managing, scaling, and maintaining these containers.
